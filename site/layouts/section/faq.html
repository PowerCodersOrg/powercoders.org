            <h6>What is Powercoders?</h6>
            <p>Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. It consists of a coding bootcamp of 13 weeks and an
                internship that lasts 6 to 12 months. It all started in Switzerland. The ultimate goal of Powercoders is
                the permanent placement of trained refugees in IT-companies and IT-departments.</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>It all started with a trip to the United States. The American government invited an
                            entrepreneur of each European country. </p>
                        <p>Founder Christian Hirsig met there two entrepreneurs, one with a cooking school for refugees,
                            one with a coding academy for women. At this time, the refugee crisis in Europe was all over
                            the news. Driven by the energy to help the idea of Powercoders was born.</p>

                        <p>There are three parties who support Powercoders. The companies pay an education fee to
                            Powercoders during internship (CHF 2'000/m already including all the costs like salary), the
                            cantons have to support Powercoders and if the students eventually are hired they are paying
                            a certain amount back on a voluntary base.</p>

                            person from a refugee background, and have a strong impact on his or her unusual life story.
                            Almost every company who offered an internship has told us that it was a very enriching

                        <p>An internship lasts at least 6 months. During this time the intern is hired at Powercoders
                            and the internship company pays CHF 2000/month to Powercoders (all inclusive: salary,
                            training, coaching, insurance, taxes, etc.).</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>That depends on the Canton. But in most Cantons the apprenticeship needs to be recognized by
                            the authorities and then the work permit can be issued.</p>

                        <p>No. There is no obligation to employ the intern after the internship in any way. However, if

                            recognised refugee with permit B or F living alone receives around 1000 CHF per month
                            (accommodation and health insurance expenses not included). Temporarily admitted persons
                            with permit F and Asylum seekers with permit N often receive much less.</p>
