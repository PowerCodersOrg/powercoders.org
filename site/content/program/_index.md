  Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. We believe that in the 21st
  century coding skills will help refugees to start a new life wherever they are
  forced to go.


  We offer a 3-month coding boot camp, followed by an internship. The ultimate
  goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in
  IT-companies and IT-departments.



  ## Our programme

  To run the program for the participants, we are dependent on the support of
  the IT industry providing internships as well as on volunteers, either as IT
  trainer to support the class teacher during the school phase or as Job-Coach
  to follow the participant during the internship.
