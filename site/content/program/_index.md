  ## Get involved

  Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. We believe that, in the 21st
  century, coding skills will help you to start a new life wherever you are
  forced to go.


  We offer a 3-month coding boot camp, followed by an internship. The ultimate
  goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in
  IT-companies and IT-departments.

      ##### You support our teachers as assistants.


      Teaching sessions usually take place in the mornings. In the afternoons,
      the participants

      focus on practising the things they learned in the morning. That’s where
      our “Trainers” come

      in, helping them individually or in groups to get their exercises and
      “homework” done.


      ###### What we are looking for


      * IT professionals who wants to support participants solving IT challenges

      * Trainers who help teaching for some days in the afternoons

      * No teaching experience needed


      If you are interested in training our participants, please check our
      current programs for opportunities.
