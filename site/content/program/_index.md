  ## Get involved


  Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. We believe that in the 21st
  century coding skills will help you to start a new life wherever you are
  forced to go.


  We offer a 3-month coding boot camp, followed by an internship. The ultimate
  goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in
  IT-companies and IT-departments.
