  Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. We believe that in the 21st
  century coding skills will help refugees start a new life wherever they are
  forced to go.


  We offer a 3-month coding boot camp, followed by an internship. The ultimate
  goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in
  IT-companies and IT-departments.

  ## The program


  ![](/img/powercoders_graphic_program_general.png)


  In order to be able to run the program, we are dependent on the support of the
  IT industry providing internships as well as on volunteers who either support
  the class teacher during school phase as IT Trainers or accompany participants
  during their internships as Job Coaches.
