  **Do you like the mountains? Do you like to climb?” – “I do now.”**


  That is the answer of a man who is not to be underestimated or discouraged. As
  a boy, Ali loved computers. So much so, he dreamed of becoming a computer
  programmer one day. An IT specialist by the age of twenty-five, it would take
  another five for Ali to find a job. This was not because of his journey from
  Syria to Switzerland, nor for a lack of trying, but rather because of his
  struggle to pursue his career within Switzerland. This struggle morphed into
  success once he joined Powercoders, and they provided the community and
  network he needed in addition to the skills he already had. Vevey is now his
  home, Evolusys his employer, and Ali sums it all up with the words “I am at
  the happiest time in my life right now.”
