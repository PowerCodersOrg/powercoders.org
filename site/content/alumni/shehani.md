  **SHEHANI'S STORY OR HOW FAR YOU CAN GET WITH HARD WORK AND DEDICATION**


  If it hadn’t been for Gajendran Packiyanathan, who knows, perhaps Shehani
  would never have heard about Powercoders. Gajendran was a participant in the
  first Powercoders batch in Bern and now works as a Software Engineer at Migros
  Aare. A relative had read about Gajendran on social media. The relative told
  her that Gajendran was also from Sri Lanka so why not give it a try as well?
  Before that, Shehani had applied literally everywhere for an IT position. She
  would have been happy with an internship but nobody was willing to give her a
  chance. Her German wasn’t good enough, they said. The fact that she had IT
  experience in SAP didn’t count there, it seems. 


  She’s one of the not so many women who applied for the Powercoders program.
  Therefore, she is one of our rare female graduates. For her, however, it
  doesn’t feel like she’s the odd one out here or as if her being a woman was
  anything special in the IT field. Having had to flee Sri Lanka together with
  her family when she was eight years old and settle in India, she grew up in a
  country where the Tech sector is something quite normal for a girl to choose
  as her career path. “In India, many girls go for engineering studies” And
  that’s what Shehani did: She chose Computer Science as her subject for her
  Bachelor’s studies. To her, this seemed like the easy choice! Then, when
  Shehani came to Switzerland, she got married. Her husband came to Switzerland
  from Sri Lanka in 2009. The two had met through Skype and spent hour after
  hour getting to know each other this way.


  Looking back at the 3 months of boot camp she calls it “hell, for someone
  inexperienced” because it’s very intense in terms of hours as well as in terms
  of how much you have to learn in such a short time. However, since she’s not
  the type to look just on the negative, she says it’s all worth it in the end.
  The program really is a good base for making it through an internship that
  might be equally as challenging. For Shehani, the struggling is a thing of the
  past now. She started her full-time job as an SAP developer at UBS in April,
  directly after her internship ended. It was a strange transition since
  everyone was working from home at the time. It was okay, though, because she
  knew the team very well already. In fact, she describes it as her destiny to
  have ended up in exactly this great team at UBS where everyone is open-minded
  and friendly. And, she adds, where it’s easy even for an introvert like
  herself to mingle with everyone. 


  Shehaniwants to express her gratitude towards everyone at UBS but her thanks
  goes out to Powercoders as well: “I think it’s very likely that without
  Powercoders, I would have had to give up my dream of working in the IT sector
  in Switzerland. I would have had to take on any job I could get, just to earn
  something.” Well, we are also very happy that it all turned out the way it
  did. As Shehani would say: “Everything that happens, happens for good.”
