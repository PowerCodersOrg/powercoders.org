  **OSMAN, WHO NEVER GAVE UP ON HIS DREAM**


  **To become a computer scientist - his dream since childhood**


  Osman is a 24-year old man from Eritrea who now lives in Switzerland and who
  was a participant of the Powercoders program. He started his computer science
  studies back in his home country because he had a dream: to become a computer
  scientist. “This technology that has evolved so rapidly and that keeps
  facilitating millions of people’s lives every day has always fascinated me.”
  From one day to the next, he was forbidden from continuing his studies, for no
  reason at all. Also, he was called upon to start his military service, like
  many other youths in Eritrea. If he wouldn’t follow this demand, he was facing
  imprisonment as a consequence. Osman was suffering from this kind of
  oppression and saw no other option than to leave the country. 


  **A long journey**


  In 2015, at the age of 20, Osman left his home all by himself. In Sudan, after
  walking for a day, he found a job: teaching English to children. He spent a
  year in Sudan, but because the situation there was very unpredictable he
  decided to continue his journey and quest for a safe place to stay. Without
  really knowing where he was going, he crossed the Sahara desert, finally
  arriving in Libya. He realized very quickly that the chances that he would be
  able to get out of there alive, were really low. He spent 5 months in prison
  but was able to miraculously escape from that hopeless situation. With the
  help of human traffickers, he crossed the Mediterranean Sea in a plastic boat
  built for 20 people - sharing it with 160 other refugees. Exactly the kind of
  picture that is so often portrayed by the media - except that for him and all
  the people on that boat, it was nothing but reality. 


  They spent 24 hours crammed together like this until they were picked up by an
  international NGO and taken on board a bigger board and then, finally, they
  were allowed to go ashore on Italian ground. Osman continued his journey alone
  by train towards Switzerland where he was taken to a center for asylum seekers
  in the Romandie. “It was a bunker, no windows, and during 4 months, we were 20
  people in a single room.” He was then moved to an apartment where he shared a
  room with another person. There was still no privacy but it definitely felt
  like a huge improvement to him. 


  Learning French quickly came very easy to Osman. He really has a knack for
  learning languages, since he speaks five already! He joined a study program by
  the city of Lausanne while he was looking for an apprenticeship. He gave it
  his all: “I applied to ALL the places in the Romandie where they have an IT
  department.” Unfortunately, with little success: only one company would invite
  him for an interview but ended up not hiring him. 


  **His chance: the Powercoders program**


  Two years after his arrival in Switzerland, Osman heard about the Powercoders
  program. That was his chance! So he applied and was chosen from among 80
  applicants for the next class. 


  At the Powercoders “Career Day” he realized that he would really like to work
  at Swisscom and - they chose him as their intern! Towards the end of his
  6-month internship, he was again looking for an apprenticeship. But this time,
  he was successful: Camptocamp offered him a contract and he is now working
  there to become a certified computer scientist. 


  **Freedom at last**


  Osman’s story proves his perseverance and courage. He now lives with his
  girlfriend and says he’s very happy and grateful that his dream has become
  true: to live in peace and to work in IT.
