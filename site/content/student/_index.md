  Our program is meant for refugees and disadvantaged citizens. We believe that
  in the 21st century coding skills will help you to start a new life wherever
  you are forced to go. 


  We offer you a 13 weeks full time coding bootcamp followed by an 6- to
  12-month internship. The ultimate goal of Powercoders is the permanent
  placement of trained refugees in IT-companies and IT-departments.
