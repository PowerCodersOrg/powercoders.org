    # Our mission


    At Powercoders, we offer an intensive coding program to female and male
    refugees with the end goal of having all our participants secure a permanent
    and full time job in the IT sector. In order to best achieve this goal, our
    program offers our students three months of courses and then the opportunity
    to do an internship.


    Our talented team of experts and volunteers has worked to build a program
    that best prepares our students and offers them the opportunity to build a
    life in their new home. We believe that coding skills are a stepping stone
    towards a new beginning and that talented refugees would benefit the
    technology sector as much as it can benefit them. 


    Get involved.
