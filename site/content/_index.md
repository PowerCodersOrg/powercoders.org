    # Our mission


    At Powercoders, we offer an intensive coding program to refugees with the
    end goal of having all our participants secure a permanent and full time job
    in the IT sector. In order to best achieve this goal, our program offers our
    students three months of courses and then the opportunity to do an
    internship.


    Our talented team of experts and volunteers has worked to build a program
    that best prepares our students and offers them the opportunity to build a
    life in their new home. We believe that coding skills are a stepping stone
    towards a new beginning and that talented refugees would benefit the
    technology sector as much as it can benefit them. 


    Get involved.
