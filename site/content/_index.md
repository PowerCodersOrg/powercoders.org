    # What do we do


    At Powercoders, we offer refugees an intensive and free coding program with
    the end goal of having all our participants secure a permanent and full time
    job in the IT sector. In order to best achieve this goal, our program offers
    our students three months of courses and then the opportunity to do an
    internship.




    Our talented team of experts and volunteers has worked to build a program
    that best prepares our students and offers them the opportunity to build a
    life in their new home. We believe that coding skills are a stepping stone
    towards a new beginning and that talented refugees would benefit the
    technology sector as much as it can benefit them. 


    Get involved.
