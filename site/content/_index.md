    ## Get Involved Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. 


    We believe that, in the 21st century, coding skills will help you to start a
    new life wherever you are forced to go.


    We offer a 3-month coding boot camp, followed by an internship. The ultimate
    goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in IT
    companies and IT departments.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
