    ## Get Involved

    Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. We believe that, in the 21st century, coding skills will help you to start a
    new life wherever you are forced to go.

    We offer a 3-month coding boot camp, followed by an internship. The ultimate
    goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in IT
    companies and IT departments.
