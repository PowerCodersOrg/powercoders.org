  ###### What is Powercoders?


  Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. It consists of a coding bootcamp
  of 13 weeks and an internship that lasts 6 to 12 months. The ultimate goal of
  Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in IT-companies and
  IT-departments. While the project started in Switzerland, we now hope to grow
  and bring our impact to other cities across the world.

      - header: How was Powercoders started?
        text: "It all started with a trip to the United States. The American government invited an entrepreneur of each European country.\r\n\nFounder Christian Hirsig met two entrepreneurs there, one with a cooking school for refugees, one with a coding academy for women. At this time, the refugee crisis in Europe was all over the news. Driven by the energy to help, the idea of Powercoders was born."
      - header: Who can participate?
        text: >-
          Talented refugees, independent from their place of living, as long as
          they are allowed to travel.
      - header: What does it cost?
        text: >-
          While the program is free for our participants, there are two main
          parties who support Powercoders. Firstly, companies donate money what
          is about 60% of our revenue. Secondly, Swiss cantons support
          Powercoders for every student who participates with CHF 5'000 what
          accounts for about 40% of the budget.
      - header: How is Powercoders financed?
        text: >-
          Powercoders is a non profit organisation that depends on volunteers.
          To cover our costs, we are supported by the Swiss government,
          foundations, companies and individuals. However, Powercoders
          appreciates every donation.
      - header: Why is a coaching included?
        text: >-
          Our participants need more than technical knowledge in order to
          achieve a sustainable integration into employment. Entering a new
          workplace and culture, with many different expectations, can be
          intimidating and isolating. This is why our program includes a coach.
          Each participant is matched with a coach that is best suited for them,
          and they are then supported throughout their internship.
      - header: Who can become a coach?
        text: >-

          other cultures and willing to spend time with their menteeonce every
          week. There are no IT skills needed, just a open and supportive
          attitude!
      - header: How long does the coaching lasts?
        text: >-
          Coaching starts towards the end of the courses and lasts until the end
          of the internship.

        text: >-
          The coaching is voluntary work. Powercoders is covering parts of the
          expenses.
      - header: Who can become a trainer?
        text: >-
          IT professionals who want to support participants in solving IT
          challenges and help with the teaching for some days in the afternoons.
          There is no teaching experience needed.

        text: >-
          We are always looking for different skill sets, so everyone willing to
          support as a trainer is welcome to apply.

          Participants at Powercoders learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the
          first seven weeks. They also learn about GIT, UX and Agile Project
          Management. The second part of the course - after Career Day and
          internship placements - focuses more on server-side
          technologies,programming languages and frameworks that are being used
          by our internship companies.

      - header: 'I have an IT company, how can I help Powercoders?'
        text: >-
          The best way is to offer an internship. If this is not possible for
          you, you can encourage your employees to join us as coaches or
          trainers or make a donation. Please [get in touch with
          us.](mailto:info@powercoders.org)
      - header: Why offer an internship for Powercoders?
        text: >-
          An internship for Powercoders is, on the one hand, is a way to offer
          an  talented people from a refugee background the opportunity to
          access a doorway into the IT labour market of Switzerland. On the
          other hand, it is the unique chance for companies to get access to raw
          talent, get in touch with a person from a refugee background, and have
          a strong impact on his or her unusual life story. Almost every company
          who offered an internship has told us that it was a very enriching
          experience for all their employees.
      - header: How long should an internship last?
        text: >-
          The average duration of an internship is 6 - 12 months. However you
          can also offer 3 months and decide later if you’d like to prolong it.
      - header: What is the Career Day?
        text: >-
          At the Career Day, we simulate a real job-finding situation. Each
          company has five minutes to present the internship they wish to offer.
          Afterwards, each company has a booth and the participants can stop by
          to ask questions and introduce themselves. The goal is to invite 3 to
          5 participants for an interview in the following week.
      - header: Are the refugees allowed to work in Switzerland?
        text: "Yes. Refugees with B or F permits are considered almost like Swiss welfare recipients. The state wants them to be integrated, have a job and become independent. The same goes for temporarily-admitted foreigners with F status.\r\n\nAsylum seekers with permit N are theoretically allowed to work, but have more difficulties getting a work permit because of the priority for people living in Switzerland."
      - header: How to get the job permit for interns?
        text: >-
          The Powercoders team files the applications for the job permits. The
          companies only have to sign the application form that we prepare for
          them, create the employment contract and pay the low fee (if there is
          one).
      - header: How long is the job permit valid for?
        text: >-
          The work permit is limited to the duration of the internship. However,
          if the same company wants to offer another internship or employment
          subsequently, the work permit can easily be adapted accordingly. A
          work permit is always only valid for the employment at the company it
          was applied for.
      - header: What is the recommended salary? Why?
        text: >-
          An internship lasts at least 6 months. During this time the intern is
          hired at Powercoders. After the internship we recommend a salary
          between CHF 60'000 and CHF 90'000 per year.
      - header: >-
          What happens to the work permit if the internship is followed up by a
          apprenticeship?
        text: >-
          That depends on the Canton. But in most Cantons the apprenticeship
          needs to be recognized by the authorities and then the work permit can
          be issued.
      - header: >-
          Does the company have to offer a job or an apprenticeship after the
          internship?
        text: >-
          No. There is no obligation to employ the intern after the internship
          in any way. However, if you want to continue to engage with your
          intern but you can’t offer a job or an apprenticeship, there are
          several alternative options:


          * prolong the internship upto one year 

          * offer a part-time internship or job and let the intern study German
          part-time 

          * offer a part-time internship or job while your intern is part-time
          studying at FH or ETH 

          * share the resource with another company in the Powercoders network
      - header: >-
          Does the company have to apply for a new job permit if the internship
          is followed up by an apprenticeship?
        text: >-
          No, the existing job permit can easily be adapted to a permit for an
          apprenticeship.
      - header: Are the participants allowed to work outside of a Canton?
        text: >-
          Yes, they are. But important is that their main work and their
          workplace is with the company that filed the working permit and within
          that Canton where the permit was issued.
      - header: Who are the participants?
        text: >-
          The participants are highly skilled refugees from various countries.
          Most of them already have a background in IT or engineering. But, the
          most important strength they bring to the table are their quick
          learning skills.
      - header: How did Powercoders select the participants?
        text: >-
          We invite applicants to apply online through a form, and if the
          application looks promising, we invite them to a Recruitment Day,
          where they are asked to take an IT-test and a personal interview. We
          look for participants with high learning skills, motivation, passion,
          talent and good team working personalities. Only the most promising
          ones are selected.
      - header: Where and how do the participants live?
        text: >-
          Most of them are living in flats offered by their social service. A
          few of them (mainly the ones who have not been granted asylum) are
          living in refugee homes.
                      
      - header: How much money does a refugee get from social welfare per month?
        text: >-
          The social welfare law of each canton regulates the amount of money
          social welfare recipients get. They follow the SKOS (Schweizerische
          Konferenz für Sozialhilfe) regulations. A recognised refugee with
          permit B or F living alone receives around 1000 CHF per month
          (accommodation and health insurance expenses not included).
          Temporarily admitted persons with permit F and Asylum seekers with
          permit N often receive much less.
