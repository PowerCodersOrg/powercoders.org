  ###### What is Powercoders?

  Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees. It consists of a coding bootcamp of 13 weeks and an
  internship that lasts 6 to 12 months. It all started in Switzerland. The ultimate goal of Powercoders is
  the permanent placement of trained refugees in IT-companies and IT-departments.

        - header: How was Powercoders started?
          text: >-
            It all started with a trip to the United States. The American government invited an
            entrepreneur of each European country.


            Founder Christian Hirsig met there two entrepreneurs, one with a cooking school for refugees,
            one with a coding academy for women. At this time, the refugee crisis in Europe was all over
            the news. Driven by the energy to help the idea of Powercoders was born.
        - header: Who can participate?
          text: >-
            Talented refugees with B and F status and in rare cases N, independent from their place of
            living, as long as they are allowed to travel.
        - header: What does it cost?
          text: >-
            There are three parties who support Powercoders. The companies pay an education fee to
            Powercoders during internship (CHF 2'000/m already including all the costs like salary), the
            cantons have to support Powercoders and if the students eventually are hired they are paying
            a certain amount back on a voluntary base.
        - header: How is Powercoders financed?
          text: >-
            Powercoders is a non profit organisation that depends on volunteers. To cover our costs, we
            are supported by the Swiss government, foundations, companies and individuals. Powercoders

        - header: Why is a coaching included?
          text: >-
            Our participants need more than technical knowledge in order to achieve a sustainable

            accompanied by one volunteering coach.
        - header: Who can become a coach?

            Career Day - focuses more on server-side technologies and programming languages and
            frameworks that are being used by our internship companies.

    items:
      - header: I have an IT company, how can I help Powercoders?
        text: >- 
            The best way is to offer an internship. If this is not possible for you, you can encourage
            your employees to join us as coaches or trainers or make a donation.
            Please [get in touch with us.](mailto:info@powercoders.org)

      - header: Why offer an internship for Powercoders?
        text: >- 
            An internship for Powercoders is, on the one hand, a shortcut for talented people from a
            refugee background who need a doorway into the IT labour market of Switzerland. On the other
            hand, it is the unique chance for companies to get ahold of raw talent, get in touch with a
            person from a refugee background, and have a strong impact on his or her unusual life story.
            Almost every company who offered an internship has told us that it was a very enriching
            experience for all their employees.

      - header: How long should an internship last?
        text: >- 
            The average duration of an internship is 6 - 12 months. However you can also offer 3 months
            and decide later if you’d like to prolong it.

      - header: What is the career day?
        text: >- 
            At the career day we simulate a real job-finding situation. Each company presents in 5
            minutes the internship they wish to offer. Afterwards each company has a booth and the
            participants can stop by. The goal is to invite 3 to 5 participants for an interview in the
            following week.

      - header: Are the refugees allowed to work in Switzerland?
        text: >- 
            Yes. Refugees with B or F permits are considered almost like Swiss welfare recipients. The
            state wants them to be integrated, have a job and become independent. The same goes for
            temporarily-admitted foreigners with F status.


            Asylum seekers with permit N are theoretically allowed to work, but have more difficulties
            getting a work permit because of the priority for people living in Switzerland.

      - header: How to get the job permit for interns?
        text: >- 
            The Powercoders team files the applications for the job permits. The companies only have to
            sign the application form that we prepare for them, create the employment contract and pay
            the low fee (if there is one).

      - header: How long is the job permit valid for?
        text: >- 
            The work permit is limited to the duration of the internship. However, if the same company
            wants to offer another internship or employment subsequently, the work permit can easily be
            adapted accordingly. A work permit is always only valid for an employment at the company it
            was applied for.

      - header: What is the recommended salary? Why?
        text: >- 
            An internship lasts at least 6 months. During this time the intern is hired at Powercoders
            and the internship company pays CHF 2000/month to Powercoders (all inclusive: salary,
            training, coaching, insurance, taxes, etc.).

      - header: What happens to the work permit if the internship is followed up by a apprenticeship?
        text: >- 
            That depends on the Canton. But in most Cantons the apprenticeship needs to be recognized by
            the authorities and then the work permit can be issued.

      - header: Does the company have to offer a job or an apprenticeship after the internship?
        text: >- 
            No. There is no obligation to employ the intern after the internship in any way. However, if
            you want to continue to engage with your intern but you can’t offer a job or an
            apprenticeship, there are several alternative options:


            * prolong the internship upto one year
            * offer a part-time internship or job and let the intern study German part-time
            * offer a part-time internship or job while your intern is part-time studying at FH or ETH
            * share the resource with another company in the Powercoders network
            
      - header: Does the company has to apply for a new job permit if the internship is followed up by an apprenticeship?
        text: >- 
            No, the existing job permit can easily be adapted to a permit for an apprenticeship.

      - header: Are the participants allowed to work outside of a Canton?
        text: >- 
            Yes, they are. But important is that their main work and their workplace is with the company
            that filed the working permit and within that Canton where the permit was issued.

      - header: Who are the participants?
        text: >- 
            The participants are highly skilled refugees from various countries. Most of them already
            have a background in IT or engineering. But most important are their learning skills.

      - header: How did Powercoders select the participants?
        text: >- 
            If the application looks promising, we invite the applicant to an IT-test and a personal
            interview. We look for participants with high learning skills, motivation, passion, talent
            and convincing personalities. Only the most promising ones are selected.

      - header: Where and how do the participants live?
        text: >- 
            Most of them are living in flats offered by their social service. A few of them (mainly the
            ones who have not been granted asylum) are living in refugee homes.
                        
      - header: How much money does a refugee get from the social welfare per month?
        text: >- 
            The social welfare law of each canton regulates the amount of money social welfare recipients
            get. They follow the SKOS (Schweizerische Konferenz für Sozialhilfe) regulations. A
            recognised refugee with permit B or F living alone receives around 1000 CHF per month
            (accommodation and health insurance expenses not included). Temporarily admitted persons
            with permit F and Asylum seekers with permit N often receive much less.
