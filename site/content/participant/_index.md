  Powercoders believes in promoting equal opportunities for diverse talents in
  the IT industry. We train candidates of diverse backgrounds to fulfil their
  potential in a digital future. 


  We offer a 13 week full-time coding bootcamp followed by a 6 to 12-month
  internship. Our goal is to support our candidates to get a permanent job in IT
  departments and IT companies.


  Our program is for you if:


  * You are living in Switzerland and have the right to work in Switzerland

  * You are facing barriers to enter the IT job market (and can’t access similar
  programs)

  * You are 18-55 years old


  Our program is for candidates of diverse backgrounds who are facing barriers
  to enter the IT job market. The majority of our seats are reserved for people
  with a refugee status. If you don’t have a refugee status, you can apply,
  too. 


  We encourage women to apply for our program. Our aim is that women make one
  third of our participants.
