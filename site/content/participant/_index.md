  the IT industry.**\

  We train candidates of diverse backgrounds to fulfil their potential in a
  digital future. 


  We offer a 13 week full-time coding bootcamp followed by a 6 to 12-month

  departments and IT companies.

  programs)

  Our program is for candidates of diverse backgrounds who are facing barriers
  to enter the IT job market. The majority of our seats are reserved for people
  with a refugee status. If you don’t have a refugee status, you can apply,
  too.

  third of our participants.
