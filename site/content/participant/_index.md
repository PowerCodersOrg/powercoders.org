  **Powercoders believes in promoting equal opportunities for diverse talents in
  the IT industry.**\

  We train women and men of diverse backgrounds to fulfil their potential in a
  digital future. 


  We offer a 13 week full-time coding bootcamp followed by a 6 to 12-month
  internship. Our goal is to support our candidates to get a permanent job in IT
  departments and IT companies. 


  The program ist fully funded and free of charge for the selected participants.


  **Our program is for you if:**


  * You are living in Switzerland and have the right to work in Switzerland

  * You are facing barriers to enter the IT job market (and can’t access similar
  programs)

  * You are 18-55 years old


  Our program is for candidates of diverse backgrounds who are facing barriers
  to enter the IT job market. The majority of our seats are reserved for people
  with a refugee status. 


  We encourage women to apply for our program. Our aim is that women make one
  third of our participants. (Reasons: Diversity helps teams. And companies are
  looking for female talents.)
