      Our participants need more than technical knowledge in order to achieve
      the goal of a successful integration in the labour market. That’s why our
      program includes coaching during the internship phase. Each participant is
      accompanied by one volunteer Job-Coach.

      * Be matched with a participant by the end of the school phase (matching
      close to your place of residence) 

      * Get ready with the help of several coaching workshops

      * Meet your coachee regularly during their internship and help them
      achieve their goals


      ###### DETAILS


      * You connect easily with people from other cultures than your own

      * You have a good understanding of the Swiss labour market and work
      culture

      * You can commit to invest time for (bi-)weekly meetings with your coachee

      ###### You support our teachers as assistants.


      Teachers in the classroom are supported by volunteer trainers (2+ half day
      commitment) to help answer questions from the student group and provide
      1:1 support during exercises.

      If you are an IT professional, would like to support our participants
      solving IT challenges and like to work in a team, come join us. We are
      also open to suggestions if you would like to provide the class with an
      input of a specific IT theme.
