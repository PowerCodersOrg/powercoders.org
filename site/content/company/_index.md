      ###### YOUR EMPLOYEES SUPPORT US AS VOLUNTEERS


      If you are convinced by what we do, you are welcome to spread the word and
      encourage your employees to support us as volunteers. We are always
      looking for IT trainers and Job-Coaches. There is also the possibility to
      support us with other talent such as helping with the social skills
      workshops.  


      ###### WHAT TO EXPECT


      * The chance to let your employees think outside the box

      * Highly motivated employees because empowering will empower them


      ###### DETAILS


      * IT Trainers are IT professionals who support our lead teacher in class 

      * Job-Coaches accompany one of the participants during the internship
      phase

      * Our students need to learn more than IT in order to succeed in the
      labour market. That’s why we provide workshops on social skills etc.
