  The Career Day is the most important day in our program. It is the day when
  the companies meet the participants. You will present you company in 2-3
  minutes on stage and then you will meet each of our participants for a short
  interview of about 5 minutes and then you select your top candidates for a
  normal interview the week after at your office. Afterwards you can take your
  final decision, if a person fits to your company.  


  **It is an efficient way for you to get to know talents through personal
  contact.**
