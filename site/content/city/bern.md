    The Powercoders team in Bern consisted Sunita Asnani, Christian Hirsig and Marco Jakob.
    Out of 150 applications they selected 15 participants who have started in January 2017 a twelve week coding boot camp.
    In April was graduation and everyone started their internships. Already in September Farid Saberi was
    the first participant who received a full-time job. We thank Migros Kulturprozent, Raiffeisen Bank, Effinger,
    Impact Hub Bern and over 50 volunteers for their great support
