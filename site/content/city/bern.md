  The Powercoders team in Bern consisted Sunita Asnani, Christian Hirsig and
  Marco Jakob. Out of 150 applications they selected 15 participants who have
  started in January 2017 a twelve week coding boot camp. In April was
  graduation and everyone started their internships. Already in September Farid
  Saberi was the first participant who received a full-time job. We thank Migros
  Kulturprozent, Raiffeisen Bank, Effinger, Impact Hub Bern and over 50
  volunteers for their great support.
