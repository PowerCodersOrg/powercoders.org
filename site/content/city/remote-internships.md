text: "**The IT industry is growing rapidly and the need for talented people is too. We will train refugees in Turkey on the technologies you need and with your help, we will be able to offer them an opportunity to get back on their career paths in the countries they are living in without moving to Switzerland.**\r\n\n**Powercoders** is expanding internationally with the support of the Swiss government to empower Swiss IT companies to fill their lack of IT talents besides creating social impact.\n\nIn a pilot project, we have teamed up with an organization called Kodluyoruz. Together we will be offering in Turkey talented refugees intensive training on the technologies you need followed by remote internships to sharpen their skills with industry experience. This means our participants stay in Turkey and work for you remotely.\n\nWe need your support by offering remote internships (6 to 12 months) to our participants. The conditions are flexible and can be defined together.\n\n<a href=\"https://forms.gle/s6TuV1jtTbAGXjneA\" class=\"btn waves-effect waves-light pwc-red\">Sign Up</a>\n\nIf you have any questions or need more details, don't hesitate to reach out to us via <a href = \"mailto: industry@powercoders.org\">Send Email</a>"
