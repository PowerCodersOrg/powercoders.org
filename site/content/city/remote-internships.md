  **The IT industry is growing rapidly and the need for talented people is too.
  We will train refugees on the technologies companies need and with companies'
  help, we will be able to offer them an opportunity to get back on their career
  paths in the countries they are living in without moving to Switzerland.**

  **Powercoders** is expanding internationally with the support of the Swiss
  government to empower Swiss IT companies to fill their lack of IT talents
  besides creating social impact.


  In a pilot project, we have teamed up with an organization called Kodluyoruz.
  Together we will be offering in Turkey talented refugees intensive training on
  the technologies you need followed by remote internships to sharpen their
  skills with industry experience. This means our participants stay in Turkey
  and work for you remotely.


  We need your support by offering remote internships (6 to 12 months) to our
  participants. The conditions are flexible and can be defined together.
