  <h2>003 Lausanne</h2>


  We started with a new team in Lausanne; Coline Sauzet as Social Lead, Hélène
  Portier as Teaching Lead, and Hussam Allaham as Program Manager. We received a
  many applications and chose 18 participants (15 men/ 3 women). The school
  started on April 23, and after 3 months of hard work all of our participants
  celebrated their graduation on July 20. Now 15 are starting their internships,
  2 have apprenticeships, and 1 has a job. A big "thank you" to all the
  trainers, coaches and companies for their support.
