  <p>At Powercoders, we offer refugees access to an intensive coding program
  with the end goal of having all our participants secure a permanent and full
  time job in the IT sector. In order to best achieve this goal, our program
  offers our students three months of courses and then the opportunity to do an
  internship.</p>

  <h2>Roles</h2>

  <p>We have four roles in our permanent team, which can be filled by two to
  four individuals. The Social Lead is responsible for the recruitment, support
  and monitoring of the students and needs to be someone who has experience in
  working with disadvantaged groups. As the main instructor, the Teaching Lead
  should be experienced in teaching IT basics and web programming. The Industry
  Lead is someone very well connected to the IT industry and their role is to
  recruit and manage the IT companies that offer internships. Lastly, the
  Operational Lead is in charge of logistics and events, and ideally has been
  organizing events in your city for years.
