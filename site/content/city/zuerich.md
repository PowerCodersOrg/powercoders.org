  ## 001 Zürich

  The team in Zürich included Sunita Asnani, Madam Monorom, Matthias Hüni, Hussam Allaham, Hannes Gassert
  and Christian Hirsig. Out of over 100 applications 18 participants (14 male/4 females) were chosen.
  They started in September 2017 the coding school. After a very successful career day 17 participants
  secured an internship and one even an apprenticeship. In December was the graduation and already in
  January most of the internships started. We thank Arcas Foundation and Impact Hub Zürich for their great
  support. Additionally we want to thank all the voluntary coaches, teachers and trainers for their effort.
