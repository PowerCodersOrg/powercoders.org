  **REGAINING TRUST IN HIMSELF AND HIS CAPABILITIES**


  Nisar Ahmed Hatami is an intelligent-looking guy who answers questions in an
  open manner. It’s very moving to observe how he conjures up even memories of
  the most horrible times from his life he eventually had to flee from. Nisar
  was born in Afghanistan but his family moved to Pakistan when he was still
  very young.


  Life, he says, was not safe for neither him nor his loved ones. Having to
  constantly watch his back to make it through the day alive and, already as a
  teen, having to deal with close friends being killed made him want to seek a
  safer life somewhere else. The vision started to evolve that he would want to
  make it to Switzerland. He knew that to reach his destination, he had to pass
  Iran, Turkey and Greece and then through “some other countries” but he didn’t
  know how to pass these countries nor, of course, whether he would make it to
  even one of them. But off he went with a clear goal ahead - and he made it!


  But why did he apply for Powercoders? He had finished college in information
  and computer science back in Quetta, Pakistan but could not continue to
  university for obvious reasons. While trying to really get settled in
  Switzerland, a friend told him about the program and he applied immediately.
  He had always loved IT because the field is always “up-to-date”. The
  fast-growing and ever-changing industry is the perfect environment for such a
  curious guy like Nisar. Recently having been promoted from intern to junior
  developer, Nisar wants to stay with Evolusys for a very long time. His aim is
  to give them back at least double the effort they invested in him by offering
  him their trust even as a new graduate and he wants “to do great things for
  them”.


  Nisar made it. He managed the journey to a safe country. He is a junior
  developer at a company he likes. It seems like the perfect story. Through it
  all however, there were many times when he felt like giving up. “It’s just so
  hard to be away from your family and everyone you know and love.” He was
  lacking the kind of support network that reminds one of “home”. Now, he is
  building himself that kind of network here in Switzerland. “I found many
  friends in Switzerland from many nationalities. And I found good friends also
  on whom I can really count and with whom I can share my mind. We share our
  happiness and we support each other in our hard times.” And he is convinced:
  “The good thing is that every hard time, every problem will pass; it’s not
  permanent.”
