  We're looking for IT companies and IT departments who would be willing in
  potentially offering an internship for our Powercoders graduates from
  July/August 2020 on. 


  Are you interested? Then join our Career Day and get an idea of our IT
  talents.


  The Career Day is the most important day in our program. It is the day when
  the companies meet the participants for a short and quick interview of about 5
  minutes to select their top candidates for a normal interview the week after
  at the company's office. Afterwards you can take your final decision, if a
  person fits to your company.  


  Next Career Day: \

  **Wednesday, May 13, 2020** at CVCI (Chambre vaudoise de commerce et
  d'industrie) [\
