  The Career Days are one of the most important milestones of our program since
  it's the days when the companies meet the participants. You will receive the
  participants' CVs and a 1min video presentation. After this, you can select
  your preferred candidates for a normal interview at your office or remotely.
  Finally you can take the decision about whether one of the participants fits
  the profile you are looking for and who that would be.


  **This is an efficient way for you to get a personal impression of the
  candidates.**
