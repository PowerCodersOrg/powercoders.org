  Do you work for an IT company or an IT department in the Romandie? \

  We are looking for companies who are potentially willing to offer an
  internship for the Powercoders graduates as of July/August 2020. \

  \

  **Are you interested? Then join our Career Day and get to know our IT
  talents.**


  The Career Day is one of the most important milestones of our program since it
  is the day when the companies meet the participants. You will briefly present
  your company on stage and then meet each of our participants for a short
  interview of about 5 minutes. After this, you can select your top candidates
  for a normal interview at your office the following week. Finally you can take
  the decision about whether one of the participants fits the profile you are
  looking for and who that would be.


  **This is an efficient way for you to get a personal impression of the
  candidates.**
