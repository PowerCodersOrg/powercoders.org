  We're looking for IT companies and IT departments who would be willing in
  offering an internship for our Powercoders graduates from July 2020 on. 


  Are you interested? Then join our Career Days and get an idea of our IT
  talents before taking your final decision. 


  The Career Day is the most important day in our program. It is the day, when
  companies meet all participants from the current class for a short and quick
  interview of about 5 minutes to select their top candidates for a normal
  interview the week after at the company's office. 


  Next Career Day: \
