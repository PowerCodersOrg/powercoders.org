  Are you interested in becoming our partner in empowering refugees? We're
  looking for IT companies and IT departments who would be willing in
  potentially offering an internship for our Powercoders graduates from
  July/August 2020 on. 


  **Join our Career Day and get an idea of our IT talents.**


  The Career Day is the most important day in our program. It is the day when
  the companies meet the participants. You will present you company in 2-3
  minutes on stage and then you will meet each of our participants for a short
  interview of about 5 minutes and then you select your top candidates for a
  normal interview the week after at your office. Afterwards you can take your
  final decision, if a person fits to your company.  


  **It is an efficient way for you to get to know talents through personal
  contact.** 


  **NEXT CAREER DAY:**  


  **Wednesday, May 13, 2020** at CVCI (Chambre vaudoise de commerce et
  d'industrie) [\
