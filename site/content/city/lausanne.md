  ## 003 Lausanne


  We started with a new team in Lausanne; Coline Sauzet as Social Lead, Hélène
  Portier as Teaching Lead, and

  Hussam Allaham as Program Manager. We received a lot of applications, and
  chose 18 participants (15 male/ 3 female).

  The school started on April 23, and after 3 months of hard work all of our
  participants celebrated the graduation

  on July 20. Now 15 are starting their internships, 2 have apprenticeships, and
  1 has a job. A big "thank you" to

  all the trainers, coaches and companies for their support
