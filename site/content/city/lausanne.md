  ## 003 Lausanne

  We started with a new team in Lausanne; Coline Sauzet as Social Lead, Hélène Portier as Teaching Lead, and
  Hussam Allaham as Program Manager. We received a lot of applications, and chose 18 participants (15 male/ 3 female).
  The school started on April 23, and after 3 months of hard work all of our participants celebrated the graduation
  on July 20. Now 15 are starting their internships, 2 have apprenticeships, and 1 has a job. A big "thank you" to
  all the trainers, coaches and companies for their support
