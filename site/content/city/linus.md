  **Interview with Linus â€“ Powercoders Program Coordinator** 


  _Why did you absolutely want to join the Powercoders team?_


  I was immediately captivated by the idea of Powercoders, and the more I
  learned about the organization, the more I got convinced by the idea. I am
  happy to take on a task here where I am certain that it is meaningful and
  opens up new perspectives for the participants. At the same time, I also
  believe that with my profile as a primary school teacher and my experience in
  organizing events, I bring along some skills that can be useful for the work
  at Powercoders. I am a very social person and I am really looking forward to
  meeting the participants, teachers and coaches in April.


  _What are the main professional stages in your life that you think qualify you
  best for your current role?_


  In my current role as Program Coordinator I am responsible for a smooth
  recruitment of the participants and job coaches and will coordinate parts of
  the bootcamp. I think my background as a teacher will be very useful in
  adapting the curriculum for the social and business skills and elaborating new
  ideas. Having been responsible for the administration of 350 workers and
  volunteers for a music festival provides me with some organisational skills to
  support me in the different administrative and organisational processes that
  await me and I have always enjoyed working with other people and bring a good
  sense of collaboration in teams.


  _You seem to be THE digital nomad in the team. Can you elaborate on that?_ 


  I am writing these lines right now in a snowy mountain hut in the canton of
  Appenzell Ausserrhoden. After so much snow has fallen I went up here with my
  touring skis and enjoy every afternoon a few dreamlike turns in the powder
  snow.


  I have my homebase in the east of Switzerland in St. Gallen, but was and am
  always a lot on the move, currently I keep the radius of course also as small
  as possible. I enjoy being able to work remotely for Powercoders and I think
  the current situation has shown many people and organisations that this offers
  many advantages for both of them. During my studies, I regularly got on the
  train to study and went someplace, for example took a walk at the lake of
  Geneva, and continued studying on the way back. From now on I will be working
  during my train rides.
