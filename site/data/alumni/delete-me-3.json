  "story": "**“Every day when I left my house, I was never sure if I will get back in the evening…”**\n\nThese are the words of Izzatollah Amani who was forced to flee his home country Afghanistan as a 26 year-old and was able to take refuge in Switzerland.\n\nHere, he started a life quickly by learning German and completing two “Schnuppersemester” at the ETH Zurich. However, he wasn’t allowed to continue his studies because he couldn’t provide the required documents.\n\nFortunately, Izzatollah heard about Powercoders. After the 3-month bootcamp at Powercoders he was chosen by the IT-company Cognizant in Zurich and successfully completed a 12-month internship. He was offered a permanent job as a junior software engineer immediately after the internship. Now he is even allowed to continue his studies in informatics at the Fachhochschule Rapperswil while working at Cognizant part-time. \n\nIt may read a little bit like a fairytale but Izzatollah’s dream has become true: to live independent of social welfare, to continue to study in the field that is his passion and most of all: to live in a country where he is safe at last."
